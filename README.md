## Research and Projects

#### 2021-2022:	MPhys Project
“Modeling quasiparticle interference in two-dimensional materials”
By considering impurity-based scattering, theoretical numerical calculations, based on T-matrix formalism, were completed to successfully replicate scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data for NbSe2 in the charge density wave (CDW) phase.  A paper is currently being prepared based on the results and insights achieved by our novel way of probing CDWs in TMDs.  Python and Fortran were both used.

#### 2021: Third-year lab project
“ATLAS”
Using Python to interface with ROOT to analyse the 13 TeV ATLAS open data set, I reproduced the cross-sections for various processes including Z, W, and Higgs boson decays.

#### 2020: Theory Computing Project
“Random Sampling and Monte-Carlo Simulation of Neutrons within a Nuclear Fission Reactor.”
The project involved using Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate the critical mass for nuclear fission reactions to be sustained via chain reaction for a variety of fuels, moderators, and geometries.  Python and Go were used to write the simulations from scratch.

## Additional Projects and Experience

#### Oomph-lib, Summer 2021

Over the 2021 summer break, I worked on a project using C++ and Gmsh to improve adaptive meshing within oomph-lib (an
object-oriented, open-source multi-physics finite-element library).

#### 2nd place in the UK CANSAT competition at the design stage, 2019-2020

I participated in a team of six in the UK CANSAT competition where we had to design and build a “satellite” that could
be dropped from a variety of hights, detect detachment, deploy parachutes, and perform additional tasks, all whilst
relaying data to a ground station designed and built by the team. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
competition was cancelled in March 2020 along with any further hands-on work. At that time, we had placed 2nd in the UK
at the design stage. Even though we could not complete the project, I gained experience through hands-on work and/or
short courses in CAD, electronics, microcontrollers, embedded programming, sensing, radio communication, aerodynamics,
and how to work and manage a group project spanning a wide range of skill sets.

#### Co-ran a robotics club at my previous secondary school, 2017
My GCSE physics teacher invited me back to co-run a robotics club aimed at introducing younger pupils to STEM through on
hands experience.

#### Academic Excellence Award, 2016

Awarded for the highest GCSE grades for my year leaving school.

#### Completed an additional GCSE out of school hours, 2014-2016

Due to my interest and aptitude for geography, I was able to complete an additional GCSE in geography. This involved
completing fieldwork analysing how river features vary along a watercourse. Overall, I received an A*.

#### BAE work experience week, 2015

After a competitive application process, I completed a work experience placement within the R&D department at BAE
Warton. I was exposed to aerodynamics research and testing, computer vision and other software development, advanced
materials research, manufacturing techniques, and CAD design.

#### Software, on-going
